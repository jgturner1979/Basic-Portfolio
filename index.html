                        <p>It's a beautiful day in the neighborhood! I wasn't born or raised in Colorado, but like most people in this state, I got here as fast as I could. Born in Hawaii and raised in Dallas, Texas, my family would vacation up in Estes Park. It was here that I discovered my love for the mountains and low humidity. I moved to Colorado in September 2007, only leaving for one year from June 2015&mdash;June 2016. I accepted a marketing position with a commercial real estate firm in Dallas. It only took one week for me to realize; Dallas was not home anymore.</p>

                        <p>I graduated from Southern Methodisty University in December 2001 with a Bachelor of Arts in Advertising and a minor in Spanish. Over the last 17 years, I've spent the majority of my career working in marketing for companies in various industries; insurance, retail/retail grocery and real estate. In almost every position, I worked with web developers to maintain front-end and back-end web applications. In the last few years, with the emergence of WordPress, I've been able to use the web platforms CMS to make non-critical updates to a company's front-end website.</p>

                        <p>I'm at the point in my career where I'm excited to make a change and delve deeper into coding and pursue my desire to be a <strong>Full Stack Web Developer</strong>.</p>
